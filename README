Ruby on Active Record (and Yaml)
 .. also bunder

This template project provides a way to use Active Record models
and database persistence without the full blown Rails framework.
This project was borne from having manually setup this structure
several times before.

Getting started:

 * Use RVM (recommended: .ruby-version provided, or use your own)
 * gem install bundler
 * bundle install
 * rake db:migrate -> to create example database with "items"
 * write your code, create more migrations (by hand, no automation yet)
 * this is a template: you might start afresh with your own .git repo
