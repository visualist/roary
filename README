This template project provides a way to use Active Record models
and database persistence without the full blown Rails framework.

Get started:

 * Use RVM (recommended: .ruby-version provided, or use your own)
 * gem install bundler
 * bundle install
 * write your code
 * this is a template: you might start afresh with your own .git repo
